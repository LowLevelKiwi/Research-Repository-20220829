# Research-Repository

This is my repositrory for the Research Repository assesment,
In this repo i have two different things, a function that will convert a matrix of numbers into an Ascii Image art as well as two different types of sorts a bubble sort and a quick sort

I got the Python sorting algorithyms code from https://realpython.com/sorting-algorithms-python/

and i was inspired by the "Compete python Development Zero To Mastery udemy series video 76 Our first gui" for the Ascii image generator
