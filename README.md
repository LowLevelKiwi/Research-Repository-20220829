# Research-Repository

This is my repositrory for the Research Repository assesment,
In this repo I have two different things, a function that will convert a matrix of numbers into an Ascii Image art as well as two different types of sorts a bubble sort and a quick sort

I chose these to do my research on because I've always wanted to learn a bit more about how sorting algorythims worked, and I liked making trying to make ascii images so I thought of a way to make creating them easier by using matrixs of numbers 

I got the Python sorting algorithyms code from https://realpython.com/sorting-algorithms-python/

and I was inspired by the "Compete python Development Zero To Mastery udemy series video 76 Our first gui" for the Ascii image generator
